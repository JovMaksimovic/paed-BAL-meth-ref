This project has developed a genome-wide DNA methylation reference panel of the 
clinically-relevant constituent cell types of paediatric Bronchoalveolar Lavage. 
This reference panel can be used in conjunction with appropriate reference-based 
deconvolution methods to adjust for cell composition in epigenome-wide 
association studies of pulmonary health and disease, particularly in paediatric 
cohorts.

# Methylation profiling of purified cell types from paediatric Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL)

This site contains the results of the analyses performed to develop a genome-wide DNA methylation reference panel of the clinically-relevant constituent cell types of paediatric Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). This reference panel can be used in conjunction with appropriate reference-based deconvolution methods to adjust for cell composition in epigenome-wide association studies of pulmonary health and disease, particularly in paediatric cohorts.

All aspects of the analysis can be explored [here](https://jovmaksimovic.github.io/paed-BAL-meth-ref/index.html).
